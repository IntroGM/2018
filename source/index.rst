The `Helsinki University Geodynamics Group <https://wiki.helsinki.fi/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=113252575>`__ is offering a one-week short course titled “Introduction to geodynamic modelling” for master's/PhD students and interested researchers.

Course goals
------------

- Understand the fundamental physical equations solved in numerical geodynamic models, how they work, and how they affect numerical experiments
- Learn how to convert the main equations used to model lithospheric deformation into simple programs
- Develop a background understanding of geodynamics that allows you to properly understand the behavior of geodynamic numerical models
