    "A function is a block of organized, reusable code that can make your code more effective, clearer to read and easier to handle.\n",
    "You can think functions as little self-contained programs that can perform a specific task which you can use repeatedly in your code.\n",
    "One of the basic principles in good programming is \"not to repeat yourself\", i.e. you shouldn't have duplicate lines of code in your script.\n",
    "Functions are a way to avoid such situations and they can save you a lot of time and effort as you don't need to retell the computer what to do every time it does a common task, such as converting temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius."
